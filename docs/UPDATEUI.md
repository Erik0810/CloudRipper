Hypermodern Frontend Revamp for SoundCloud Playlist Downloader
Overview
This document details the revamp of the current retro UI for the Flask-based SoundCloud Playlist Downloader. The upgrade will focus exclusively on the frontend. All backend logic and existing JavaScript interactions remain intact.

Objectives
Transition from a retro design to a hypermodern, sleek interface.
Implement a design featuring a black background with white and blue accents.
Introduce smooth extravagant animations and modern UI elements.
Ensure full compatibility with the current JavaScript functionalities.
Design Guidelines
Color Scheme
Background: Black (#000000)
Primary Text: White (#FFFFFF)
Accents: Various shades of blue (e.g., #007BFF, #0056b3)
Typography
Utilize modern, sans-serif fonts (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans).
Ensure clear hierarchy with appropriate font sizes for headings, subheadings, and body text.
Layout & Responsiveness
Create a fully responsive layout that is focused on desktop as the downloader isnt functional on mobile.
Employ modern CSS layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid for efficient structuring.
Animations & Interactivity
Use CSS transitions and IMPRESSIVE animations to enhance user experience (e.g., hover effects, smooth page transitions).
Technical Specifications
Frontend Technologies
HTML5: Update the markup to utilize semantic HTML5 elements.
CSS3: Develop custom styles using CSS, or consider preprocessors like SASS for maintainability.
JavaScript: Integrate with the existing JavaScript code without altering its functionality. New UI components and animations must work in harmony with current event listeners and API calls.
Integration with Existing JavaScript
The revised frontend must seamlessly interact with the current JavaScript functionality.
Preserve all event handlers and API interactions. Any enhancements should not interfere with the core functionality of the downloader.
Ensure that modifications are modular, allowing for easy rollback if integration issues arise.
